```

`saveToJSON` arguments:

```javascript
saveToJSON(data, filename);

You can multiplicate waiting time for loading information by set `timeMultiplier` before starting the parser:

import { amazon } from "ecommerce-scraper-js";

amazon.timeMultiplier = 2; // double Amazon load times

amazon.getListings().then(console.log);
```
